after it's done it closes the file.

enters "3".

A3. When the user enters "1";
    	a. Asks and reads the name and phone number of the new employee.
    	b. Input to the 2 lists.
	c. Sort the lists by name with bubble sort.
	d. Opens the file "phonebook.txt" and replaces the content of the file with the content of the new lists.
